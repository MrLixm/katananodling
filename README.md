Package for Foundry Katana software.

A simple API to create and register a custom type of node called "CustomNode"
, a SuperTool but in much simple.

Made to ease the maintenance of tools, instead of relying on "clunky" and baked Macros,
get easily upgradable nodes that works well in a version-controlled pipeline.

Have a look at [./demolibrary/demo](./demolibrary/demo.py) to see how a new type
of node can simply be created.
